# Solution

Firstly, thank you for giving me this opportunity to present my work.

Here is what to address the three tasks:

## Fix register and login issue

Tried to register with my email. After hitting the "Send" button nothing happened. Inspecting the chrome developer console reveals CORS is blocking the request.

Edited the env.js file to point to the local backend. 
After this the interface does respond with a notification, but it is a "Fail!" notification.

The backend reported the following error:
![Auth issue](screenshots/screen3.png)

Did some research into nodemailer. Didn't trust the credentials given with the project (.env file in the backend folder), so tried with my own google account. That resolved the issue and the email was successfully sent. 
At some point I also realized that the backend queries a database to check if the user exists, so I fired up my XAMPP and imported the database from new_mgldefi.sql file in the db folder. Had to change utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci collation to utf8mb4_unicode_ci though, since I'm working on a Windows machine (ðŸ˜“).

After that, it was easy sailing.

## Add current Eth price on profile page

Please note that I again had to use my personal coinmarketcap credentials because the one supplied in the .env file had used up the montly quota.

## Add Wallet connect on profile page

Solution in this PR: [Pull request](https://github.com/tculig/infobipskilltest/pull/2) 

Went with the simple solution of resuing a button and redirecting to an existing page:

Takes the user to here:

Verified that it succesfully changes the wallet:

# General thoughts and comments

Hopefully this work is satisfactory and you will consider me for your team.

On the topic of "please document any bugs, glitches, or areas for improvement that you encounter during the testing process."

There's a lot that can be written here, and would be hard to go through everything without sounding like a smartass. 
This is clearly an older project, and has not been updated in several years. As such, its perfectly functional.

If I were to bring it to the "bleeding edge", I'd rewrite it to React 18 (allthough, from what I've heard last few days about upcoming React 19, I'd actually hold of until that's released). I would also introduce Typescript to the repo. 
There's a whole bunch of unused variables, uneven formatting. Could use with some linting and styling, but that's neither here nor there.

Also not sure if its part of the test (probably is), there were some random "Object" declarations in the components/providers/UserProvider.js file. And there's also an undefined function called "getTokenBaseInfo" in the backend/src/utils/wallet.utils.js, but the backend never crashed because of it (which I'm sure it would at some point).

I'll end it there.

Please let me know if you need anything else!

Best,
